Time Series data is a series of data points indexed in time order. Time series data is everywhere, so manipulating them is important for any data analyst or data scientist.

 In this notebook, I will discover and explore data from the stock market, particularly some technology stocks (Apple, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft). I will visualize different aspects of it using Seaborn and Matplotlib. I will look at a few ways of analyzing the risk of a stock, based on its previous performance history. I will also be predicting future stock prices through a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) method!

 I'll be answering the following questions along the way: 
What was the change in price of the stock over time?
What was the daily return of the stock on average?
What was the moving average of the various stocks?
What was the correlation between different stocks'?
How much value do we put at risk by investing in a particular stock?
How can we attempt to predict future stock behavior? (Predicting the closing price stock price of APPLE inc using LSTM)
Apply seasonal decomposition to identify trends, seasonality, and residuals.
Add annotations or labels to highlight significant events in the time-series data.






**Introduction**
Stock Market Analysis and Prediction is the project on technical analysis, visualization, and prediction using data provided by Google Finance. By looking at data from the stock market, particularly some giant technology stocks and others. Used pandas to get stock information, visualized different aspects of it, and finally looked at a few ways of analyzing the risk of a stock, based on its previous performance history. Predicted future stock prices through a Monte Carlo method!

**Purpose**
The purpose of this project is to comparatively analyze the effectiveness of prediction algorithms on stock market data and get general insight on this data through visualization to predict future stock behavior and value at risk for each stock. The project encompasses the concept of Data Mining and Statistics. This project makes heavy use of NumPy, Pandas, and Data Visualization Libraries.
